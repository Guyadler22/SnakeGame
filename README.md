## Description
The Snake game is a simple yet engaging game where the player controls a growing snake. The objective is to eat apples which appear randomly on the screen, causing the snake to grow longer. Each apple eaten increases the player's score.

## Gameplay
The snake moves continuously and the player directs its movement using the keyboard arrows. The challenge is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body as it grows longer.

### Features
- **Adjustable Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose from four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme), which control the speed of the snake.
- **Score Tracking:** The game tracks how many apples the snake eats.
- **Smooth Controls:** Responsive arrow key controls for navigating the snake across the game area.

### Technical Stack
- **Language:** Java
- **User Interface:** Java Swing for GUI components.

### Objective
Collect as many apples as possible to increase the score. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or itself.
